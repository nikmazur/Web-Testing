# Web-Testing
This project (built with Maven) is a group of web tests using Firefox Selenium Webdriver (geckodriver.exe, included with the project) and TestNG as the testing framework. It consists of 2 separate classes with tests, and another class with commonly used methods. Screenshots of the browser window are taken and stored in the project directory automatically at the end of each test.  

For testing I chose 2 different websites:

https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

![alt text](https://github.com/nikmazur/Web-Testing/blob/master/bin/theinternet.png "Dave Haeffner’s Practice Site")

This website consists of separate pages with various web elements designed for running simple tests (e.g. working with logins, drop-down lists, downloading files). It’s useful for demonstrating basic manipulations with content.

Selenium Easy is a website with various automation tutorials. It has a seperate section with diffrent widgets (calendar, intervactive tables, pop-up messages and JavaScript windows) for practicing selenium tests. Provides a nice addition to the previous site for testing various scenarios.
